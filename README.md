# Dont-Touch-The-Green-Balls

Another iPhone game I made when in highschool.

The basic idea is that green balls would rain from the top of the screen and you had to move your player from side to side to avoid them.
Different power up balls would ocasionaly fall that you coulsd hit and then get a brief moment with a 'super power' such as invincability, or all the balls would shrink.

Pretty simple. One of the first I created
